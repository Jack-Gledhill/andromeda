# Andromeda

Andromeda is my personal development machine, named after the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy), and is a sister to my Kubernetes cluster called [Constellation](https://github.com/constellation-net).

The purpose of this repository is to store Andromeda's configuration files so that the environment can be easily recreated should I replace the machine or reinstall the OS. It also contains some documentation on things that can't be automated, e.g. apps.
